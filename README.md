## About the Project  
**HCS-Manager** is a lightweight web app built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to help users **manage and track their skin transactions** — including purchases, sales, and profit margins.  

It allows you to visualize how much you've **earned or spent** over time, making it easy to analyze your activity in **CS2 Market**.

### Features  
- Track and manage all your skin movements  
- Calculate total earnings and expenses  
- Local data persistence (no backend required)  
- Export and import your data easily  
- Clean and responsive interface  

## Built With  
This project was developed using:  
- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** for design and responsive layout  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** for logic and data management  
- **LocalStorage** for persistent client-side storage  

Repository: [github.com/JMF-Alex/HCS-Manager](https://github.com/JMF-Alex/HCS-Manager)
